Only need at the end the sobol.py and _sobol.so.

USING IT
Enter python shell

>>> import sobol
>>> sobol.emergency(DIMENSIONALITY, SEED, RANDOM_INT)

this function gives back a real number which is the (RANDOM_INT)th position in the vector generated by the sobol sequence. 

-- 0 <= RANDOM_INT < DIMENSIONALITY
-- SEED must be changed on each iteraction
